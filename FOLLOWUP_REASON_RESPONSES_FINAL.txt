Follow-up Reason Responses - Context-Aware Messaging

## Purpose
Provide tailored, empathetic responses based on the specific follow-up reason the user selects. Each reason requires different tone and messaging.

---

## 1. Scheduled Follow-up

**User Selection:** "Scheduled follow-up" (Doctor asked patient to return)

**Context:** This is a planned, routine follow-up as instructed by the doctor. The patient is returning as expected, not due to worsening symptoms.

**Response Template:**
```
"Got it. Any updates you'd like to share with the doctor? This will help the doctor prepare for your visit. You can also skip this."
```

**Alternative Variations:**
- "Perfect! Any updates you'd like to share with the doctor? This will help the doctor prepare for your visit. You can also skip this."
- "Understood. Would you like to share any updates since your last visit? This will help the doctor prepare for your visit. You can also skip this."
- "Got it. Any changes in your condition the doctor should know about? This will help the doctor prepare for your visit. You can also skip this."

**Tone:**
- Routine, matter-of-fact
- Not overly concerned
- Optional/casual about notes

**Storage:**
```json
{
  "followup_reason": "scheduled",
  "followup_context": "Planned follow-up as instructed by doctor"
}
```

**Next Step:** Ask for followup_notes (optional, can skip)

**Component:** Free text input with prominent "Skip" button

---

## 2. New Concern

**User Selection:** "New concern" (Different issue than last visit)

**Context:** Patient is returning but for a DIFFERENT health issue than the previous visit. This is not about the original condition.

**Response Template:**
```
"What new symptoms or changes have you noticed? This will help the doctor prepare for your visit. You can also skip this."
```

**Alternative Variations:**
- "I see, you have a different concern this time. What new symptoms or changes have you noticed? This will help the doctor prepare for your visit. You can also skip this."
- "Understood. Could you tell me about the new symptoms? This will help the doctor prepare for your visit. You can also skip this."
- "Got it. What new symptoms or changes have you noticed? This will help the doctor prepare for your visit. You can also skip this."

**Tone:**
- Attentive, open
- Slightly more inquisitive (it's a new issue)
- Still optional, not pushy

**Storage:**
```json
{
  "followup_reason": "new_concern",
  "followup_context": "Patient has different/new concern unrelated to previous visit"
}
```

**Next Step:** Ask for followup_notes (optional, can skip)

**Component:** Free text input with "Skip" option

**Note:** Doctor may need more context since this isn't about the original condition they treated

---

## 3. Ongoing Issue

**User Selection:** "Ongoing issue" (Same problem, not better)

**Context:** The original condition has NOT improved or has worsened. Patient is concerned that treatment didn't work or symptoms persist.

**Response Template:**
```
"I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe what's still bothering you? This will help the doctor prepare for your visit. You can also skip this."
```

**Alternative Variations:**
- "I understand, the previous issue is still bothering you. Can you describe what's still bothering you? This will help the doctor prepare for your visit. You can also skip this."
- "Got it. How have your symptoms been since the last visit? This will help the doctor prepare for your visit. You can also skip this."
- "I see. What symptoms are continuing? This will help the doctor prepare for your visit. You can also skip this."

**Tone:**
- Empathetic, concerned
- Acknowledges patient's frustration/discomfort
- Gentle, supportive

**Storage:**
```json
{
  "followup_reason": "ongoing_issue",
  "followup_context": "Original condition persisting or not improving as expected"
}
```

**Next Step:** Ask for followup_notes (optional, can skip)

**Component:** Free text input with "Skip" option

**Note:** This requires the most empathy - patient may be frustrated that treatment didn't work

## Summary - Key Principles

🎯 **Reason-specific tone:** Match empathy level to the reason
📝 **Always optional:** Never make notes feel required
🔄 **Smooth transitions:** Move quickly to previous doctors after notes
💬 **Concise messaging:** 1-2 sentences per response
❤️ **Show empathy:** Especially for "ongoing issue"
✅ **Acknowledge input:** Thank user if they provide notes
🚫 **No guilt:** Accept skips gracefully
📅 **Provide context:** Mention last visit date for continuity
🏥 **Highlight continuity:** Emphasize doctor has patient's history
⚡ **Keep moving:** Don't dwell on any single step

**Remember:** Follow-up notes are a BONUS for the doctor to prepare, not a REQUIREMENT for booking. Keep the flow moving smoothly while giving users the option to share context if they want to.
